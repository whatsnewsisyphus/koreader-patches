## Unified Progress Widget Styling
Super customizable progress widget that allows you to set dynamic progress bars and status badges (dogear) with options for styling and function. You can choose different track and background colors for different statuses, outline most recently read book or give it a differen fill color, among many other things. Everything is commented, and there is a debug feature you can enable if things don't work, send me your crash log if that hapens.

It is also compatible with page numbers display, including modifying progress bar lengths by book length. Everything is in the comments of the code.

If using project title, this will only work when progress bars are visible, selecting Show % instead of progress bars will intentionally restore original behaviour. 

There appears to be a screenshot bug that shows the clock when a screenshot is taken, ignore that bit.

Make sure to grab the dogear icons from my icons folder for the status badges, or feel free to replace them with your own.
