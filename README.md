## Unified Progress Widget
Super customizable progress widget that allows you to set dynamic progress bars and status badges (dogear) with options for styling and function. You can choose different track and background colors for different statuses, outline most recently read book or give it a differen fill color, among many other things. Everything is commented, and there is a debug feature you can enable if things don't work, send me your crash log if that hapens.

If using project title, this will only work when progress bars are visible, selecting Show % instead of progress bars will intentionally restore original behaviour. 

I don't have page numbers in my titles (yet) so I haven't had a chance to develop compatibility with the progress bar width based on book length feature.

There appears to be a screenshot bug that shows the clock when a screenshot is taken, ignore that bit.
